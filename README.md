`OLD Build`
# Disconnect
## About
Disconnect is a new discord bot looking to make life simpler (The point of every bot) We try to make everything as automated as it can be. With moderation, music, utility, fun modules and much more, we try to fit in a general direction bot that focuses on not one thing. We have many ideas we are thinking about adding to the bot as we are always looking for new ways to improve Disconnect. With our most recent rebuild of Disconnect, you should experience a great experience. Please try Disconnect out and give us a little love, we are a small team (1 person) and looking to make more projects in the future but it all depends on the support we get from you guys.
